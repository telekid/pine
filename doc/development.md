# Running a development repl

in Spacemacs, `,"` will start a Clojure repl and a CLJS repl.
When prompted, choose Figwheel as the repl type.

To finish starting your CLJS repl, open a browser to `localhost:3449`.

*TODO:* Create a lein task that opens `localhost:3449` in a headless browser.


# Testing pine

Run `lein test` at the command line.
Note: You may need to run `npm install -g karma-cli`
